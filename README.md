Hi, I’m Priyansh from Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh), India. I’m currently learning and practicing financial modeling and Excel dashboards.
This website is my learning journal and portfolio. I share blog posts, sample dashboards, and case studies as I grow my skills. My goal is to build credibility step by step—showing not just the final results, but also the process of learning and improvement.
I believe even small progress matters. If my work helps someone make a better decision or earns me even ₹1, that’s a milestone worth celebrating.
