# 👋 Hi, I’m Priyansh

I’m currently on a **finance learning journey**, focused on:
- Financial modeling in Excel
- FP&A dashboards for events and businesses
- Case studies and practice projects

## 🌱 Current Stage
- Publishing practice dashboards and blog posts
- Building credibility step by step, with transparency

## 📂 Portfolio
This profile will showcase:
- Sample Excel models
- Case studies (FP&A, startup valuation)
- Blog posts documenting my learning journey

## 🎯 Goal
To grow my skills, share progress openly, and eventually help clients in India and globally with reliable financial models. Even a small project that earns ₹1 is a milestone worth celebrating.
